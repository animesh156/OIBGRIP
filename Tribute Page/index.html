          <b>M.S. Dhoni </b>, in full <b> Mahendra Singh Dhoni </b>, (born July
          7, 1981, Ranchi, Bihar [now Jharkhand] state, India), Indian cricketer
          whose rise to prominence in the early 21st century culminated in his
          captaincy of the Indian national team that won the one-day Cricket
          World Cup in 2011. He made his ODI debut for the national team on
          December 23, 2004, against Bangladesh and went on to serve as the
          captain of the Indian ODI team from 2007 to 2016. He debuted as a Test
          player against Sri Lanka on 2nd December 2005, and led the team in
          Test cricket from 2008 to 2014. Known for his aggressive playing
          style, he is revered as one of the best "finishers" in the limited
          over format of the game. He is also one of the most successful Indian
          captains and holds a number of records for his captaincy. Notably, the
          Indian team became the No.1 Test team in 2009 under his captaincy. He
          also led the Indian team to win the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 and the
          2013 ICC Champions Trophy. While his achievements in the IPL format
          often get overshadowed by his international records, he also helped
          his team, Chennai Super Kings, win IPL twice in 2010 and 2011.

          <button type="button">Early Career</button>

          <ul class="a">
            <li>
              In 1998, M. S. Dhoni, who had been playing only in school and club
              level cricket till then, was selected to play for the Central Coal
              Fields Limited (CCL) team. He impressed Deval Sahay, an ex Bihar
              Cricket Association Vice-President, with his determination and
              hard-hitting skills, which opened up opportunities for him to play
              in First Class cricket.
            </li>

            <li>
              During the 1998-99 season, he failed to make it to the East Zone
              U-19 squad or Rest of India squad, but he was selected for the
              East Zone U-19 squad for the CK Nayudu trophy in the next season.
              Unfortunately, he could not perform well and his team finished
              last in the tournament.
            </li>

            <li>
              He made his Ranji Trophy debut for Bihar cricket team during the
              1999-2000 season with a score of 68 not out in the second innings.
              He scored his maiden first-class century during a game against
              Bengal in the following season, but his team lost the game.
            </li>

            <li>
              Coming from a middles class Indian family, money was not a luxury
              for him. In fact, at the age of 20, he moved to Midnapore, West
              Bengal, after securing a Travelling Ticket Examiner (TTE) job at
              Kharagpur railway station via sports quota. He served as a railway
              employee from 2001 to 2003.
            </li>

            <li>
              In 2001, he was selected to play the Duleep Trophy for the East
              Zone; however, Bihar Cricket Association could not communicate
              this information to Dhoni in time, as he was located in Midnapore.
              He learnt this at a time when his team had already reached
              Agartala, the venue for the match. While one of his friends
              managed to hire a car for him to reach Kolkata Airport for a
              flight, the car broke down halfway, resulting in Deep Dasgupta
              serving as the wicketkeeper.
            </li>

            <li>
              He was eventually picked for the India A squad for a tour of
              Zimbabwe and Kenya during 2003-04. He took 7 catches and had
              stumpings during a match against Zimbabwe XI. He also helped his
              team defeat Pakistan A in back-to-back matches, scoring a half
              century in the first, followed by two centuries. With such
              performance, he got noticed by the then Indian National Team
              captain Sourav Ganguly.
            </li>

          <button type="button">ODI Career</button>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Following his superb performance in first-class cricket, M. S.
              Dhoni was selected to play in the national ODI team for India's
              tour of Bangladesh in 2004-05. Unfortunately, he got run out for a
              duck in his debut match and could not perform very well during the
              rest of the series.
            </li>

            <li>
              Despite poor performance in his debut series, the selectors showed
              faith in him by selecting him for the Pakistan ODI series that
              followed. Dhoni didn't disappoint them as he scored a record
              breaking 148, most by an Indian wicketkeeper-batsman, in his fifth
              ODI match.
            </li>

            <li>
              Dhoni, who did not get enough opportunities to bat in the first
              two matches of the India-Sri Lanka bilateral series, was promoted
              in the batting order for the third match of the series. He
              utilized the opportunity fully by scoring a speedy 183 not out off
              145 balls while chasing a target of 299. He broke a number of
              records during the series and was named Man of the Series for his
              performance.
            </li>

            <li>
              During the India-Pakistan ODI series of 2005-06, he contributed
              68, 72 not out, 2 not out and 77 not out in four of the five
              matches to help his team win the series 4-1. With his consistent
              performance, he dethroned Ricky Ponting to reach the top of the
              ICC ODI Rankings for batsmen on 20 April 2006, even though just
              for a week.
            </li>

            <li>
              In the two series against West Indies and Sri Lanka before the
              2007 Cricket World Cup Tournament, Dhoni showed terrific
              performance with an average of over 100. However, he failed to
              perform during the World Cup and the Indian team could not go
              beyond the group stage in the tournament.
            </li>
            <li>
              He led India to victory in the 2011 World Cup. In the final match
              against Sri Lanka, he promoted himself up the batting order and
              played a match winning knock of 91 not out.
            </li>

            <li>
              In 2013, he captained India to victory in the ICC Champions Trophy
              and became the only captain to have won all the ICC trophies, i.e
              Test Mace, ODI World Cup and Champions Trophy.

        <ul>
          <li>
            M. S. Dhoni was selected into the Indian Test Team as a wicketkeeper
            during the series against Sri Lanka in 2005. He scored 30 runs in
            his debut match, which was interrupted by rain. He scored his first
            half-century in the following match, helping India win with a big
            margin.
          </li>

          <li>
            During India's tour of Pakistan in early 2006, he scored his maiden
            test century in an aggressive innings that helped India avoid
            follow-on. He continued to perform well in the next three matches,
            one against Pakistan and two against England
          </li>

          <li>
            Dhoni, who served as the vice-captain during the series against
            Australia in 2008, was promoted to fulltime test captaincy in the
            fourth match after the then captain Anil Kumble got injured in the
            previous match and announced his retirement.
          </li>

          <li>
            He went on to score two centuries in 2009 during the series against
            Sri Lanka to lead his team to victory. Under his captaincy India,
            went on to become the No. 1 Team in the ICC Test Rankings in
            December 2009.
          </li>

          <li>
            He retired from Test cricket after the third match during India's
            tour of Australia in the 2014-15 season. He continued to play ODIs
            in the following years, but retired from ODI captaincy in January
            2017. However, he is still available to play limited over cricket.
